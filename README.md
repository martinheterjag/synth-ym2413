ABOUT

This project is based on a PIC18 that is controlling a 
Yanaha YM-2413. Currently the code is based on a arduino
project made by Bart Venneker (www.bartvenneker.nl).

When i get something working i will evolve the project
to a Eurorack FM synth module. Currently there is an error
instead of playing sounds i hear short clicks. I once heard
a piano like sound, but was not able to reproduce it.

SETUP

Use PICkit 3 to program the PIC18i.
I will upload a schematic in near future.
